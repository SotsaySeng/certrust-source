# Enabling OAuth2 / OIDC Login

This is documentation plus one frontend page, deliberately **not** a
backend integration — Strapi's `users-permissions` plugin already ships
built-in connect strategies for Google, GitHub, Discord, and several other
providers. Enabling one is a matter of configuration, not code, and that
configuration is admin-panel/database-driven, not a `config/plugins.ts`
setting (unlike everything else in this backend). This doc exists so
"enable OAuth2/OIDC login" has a real, correct path rather than a
fabricated code path Strapi doesn't actually use.

**This has not been end-to-end tested** — doing so needs a real OAuth
app (client ID/secret) from an actual provider, which wasn't available in
the environment this was written in. Treat the steps below as accurate per
Strapi's own documented behavior, but have a human verify a real login
before relying on it.

## What's included in this pass

- `src/frontend/pages/auth/callback.vue` — a landing page for after the
  provider redirect completes. Reads `?access_token=<jwt>` (or `?error=...`)
  from the query string, and if present, calls the new
  `useAuthStore().loginWithOAuthToken(jwt)` (backed by
  `AuthClient.loginWithToken()`, `src/frontend/api/auth-client.ts`) to
  hydrate the session exactly like a local login does, then redirects to
  `/dashboard`.
- No backend code changes — the connect strategies are already part of
  `@strapi/plugin-users-permissions`.

## Enabling a provider (e.g. Google)

1. Create an OAuth app with your chosen provider (e.g. in Google Cloud
   Console) and obtain a client ID and secret.
2. In the provider's app settings, set the authorized redirect URI to
   Strapi's callback endpoint:
   `<backend-url>/api/connect/google/callback`
   (replace `google` with the provider name for other providers).
3. In Certrust's Strapi admin panel: **Settings → Users & Permissions
   Plugin → Providers**, select the provider, enable it, and enter the
   client ID/secret from step 1.
4. In the same provider settings screen, set the **redirect URL** field to
   the frontend callback page added in this pass:
   `<frontend-url>/auth/callback`
5. From the frontend, initiate login by navigating to:
   `<backend-url>/api/connect/google`
   Strapi redirects to the provider, then back to
   `<backend-url>/api/connect/google/callback`, which Strapi itself
   exchanges for a JWT and redirects to the frontend redirect URL from
   step 4 with `?access_token=<jwt>` appended.

No "Sign in with Google" button exists in the UI yet — wiring one into
`login.vue` (pointing at `<backend-url>/api/connect/<provider>`) is a small,
reasonable follow-up once a provider is actually configured and the
callback flow above has been verified against it.

## What's explicitly out of scope here

- LDAP and SCIM — unrelated to `users-permissions`' OAuth providers, not
  addressed at all.
- A UI for admins to manage which providers are enabled beyond Strapi's own
  admin panel screen.
- Programmatically seeding provider config (e.g. via `.env` + a bootstrap
  script) instead of the admin panel — Strapi doesn't offer a documented
  config-file-based path for this, and reverse-engineering one wasn't worth
  the risk for a feature that needs live credentials to verify anyway.
