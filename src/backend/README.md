## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 6.0.0
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd src/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run develop
   ```

4. Access the admin panel at: http://localhost:1337/admin

### Sample Data & Permissions (Development)

When running in development mode, the application automatically:
1. **Seeds the database** with sample data on first startup
2. **Configures permissions** for authenticated and public roles

**Default login credentials (same for admin panel and frontend):**
- Email: `admin@certrust.dev`
- Password: `certrust`

**Sample data includes:**
- A Strapi admin user (for the admin panel at `/admin`)
- An API user (for frontend authentication)
- A profile (configured as both Issuer and Recipient)
- A sample achievement ("Welcome to Certrust")
- A sample credential/badge awarded to the admin user

**Permissions automatically configured:**
- Authenticated users can access all profile, achievement, credential, evidence, and endorsement endpoints
- Public users can read profiles, achievements, credentials, and verify badges

The seed data and permissions are only created if the admin user doesn't already exist. To reset and reseed:
1. Stop the application
2. Delete the database (or remove Docker volumes with `docker-compose down -v`)
3. Restart the application

> Note: Seeding is disabled in production (`NODE_ENV=production`).

### Environment Variables

The application uses various environment variables for configuration. 
In a production environment, make sure to set:

- `HOST` - Host name (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT` - Port to run on (default: 1337)
- `APP_KEYS` - Secret keys for the app
- `API_TOKEN_SALT` - Salt for API tokens
- `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for admin
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for API
- `DATABASE_CLIENT` - Database client (default: sqlite, recommend postgres for production)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection URL (for postgres/mysql)
- `FRONTEND_URL` - URL to the frontend application (for email links)
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` - Email provider configuration (for sending certificate notifications)
- `ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8` - Ed25519 private key in PKCS8 format (base64 encoded) for signing credentials

#### Generating an Ed25519 Key Pair

The application requires an Ed25519 private key to sign verifiable credentials. To generate one:

```bash
node -e "
const { generateKeyPairSync } = require('crypto');
const { privateKey } = generateKeyPairSync('ed25519');
const pkcs8 = privateKey.export({ type: 'pkcs8', format: 'pem' });
console.log(Buffer.from(pkcs8).toString('base64'));
"
```

Set the output as the `ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8` environment variable.

> **Note:** The docker-compose.yml includes a development key by default. **Never use the default key in production!**

## Working with Open Badges 3.0

The backend implements the [Open Badges 3.0 specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/) and [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

Key components:

- **Credential Service**: Handles credential lifecycle (issuance, verification, revocation)
- **OpenBadge Service**: Transforms internal data to Open Badge 3.0 format
- **Verification Service**: Validates the authenticity of credentials
- **Revocation Service**: Manages credential revocation status

## Permissions Setup

Strapi uses a role-based permission system. For Certrust, you'll need to configure:

1. Public routes (credential verification, public badge viewing)
2. Authenticated routes (user credential management)
3. Admin routes (achievement and issuer management)

See `permissions-fix.md` for detailed instructions on setting up the correct permissions.

## Development

### Custom API Creation

To create a new API:

```bash
npx strapi generate
```

Select "api" from the menu and follow the interactive prompts.

### Adding a Custom Controller Method

Create a custom controller method by extending the core controller:

```typescript
export default factories.createCoreController('api::yourmodel.yourmodel', ({ strapi }) => ({
  async customMethod(ctx) {
    // Your custom logic
  },
}))
```

## Deployment

To build the Strapi application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```
